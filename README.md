## Synopsis

This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code puzzles (http://adventofcode.com/) generated for this GitHub account. The solutions are not be very high quality since working on them usually ended after the correct answer was obtained.

For year 2016 one personal goal was to learn some Rust, so most of the code is Rust except for first few days which were written in Python or C++.

2015 was started after I finished 2016 and is written as one big Rust project. It even containins some unit tests (!!). This project is not quite yet finished.

## Installation

After cloning this repository you'll also need Rust installation from https://www.rust-lang.org/, Python 3 runtime from https://www.python.org/ and a C++ compiler (Code::Blocks project is provided) to run all solutions, although majority of code is written in Rust so that should suffice.
